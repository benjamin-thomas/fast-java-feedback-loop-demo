## Requirements

Linux only for now.

MacOS would need a specific file watcher. Apart from that everything should work the same.

For Windows, WSL should make things work.

## How to use

### Step 1: start a watch process in a separate terminal

```bash
./manage/dev/watch
```

### Step 2: launch the dev entrypoint

```bash
./manage/dev/watch
```
